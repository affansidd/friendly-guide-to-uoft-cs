## Introduction

Throughout our university careers, we are faced with quite a few decisions that we have to make without exactly knowing what we are getting into. Throughout this process we, a group from the [Technology Leadership Initiative](https://www.technologyleadershipinitiative.com/), have been able to rely on guidance and various mentors along the way. This document is our attempt to return the favour to the community with some of our experiences and expertise navigating the maze of possibilities within UofT for Computer Science students. 

## Collaboration

The aim is to have this document updated as new opportunities or experiences arise. Therefore, if you'd like to be a part and feel like you could contribute to anything that is being said here, please:

First, fork the repository and make any changes you believe help contribute to this knowledge bank. Then, press **contribute** on your repository and open a pull request to the original repository. Admins of the original repository will review and merge your pull request. 

## Courses

Course selection can be a quite daunting task. It is often hard to get a real sense of a course based simply on the [FAS Calendar's](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/) description. However, that is where you will find the official course description and prerequisites for any course offered in the current school year. Therefore, the calendar (along with your Acorn account) should be your primary source for the most recent and most accurate information. 

### UofT's Official Resources:

- [Degree Explorer](https://degreeexplorer.utoronto.ca/degreeExplorer/): the Degree Explorer is linked to your acorn account and will help you have a broader picture of your degree requirements by showing the courses you've already taken as well the course you still must take for completion.
- [Timetable](https://timetable.iit.artsci.utoronto.ca/): the Timeteable comes in really handy once or twice a year when you planning out your timetable with the possible sections/courses you'd like to attend. It allows for a quick and easy way navigate through the available courses thorugh the various filters you get to choose under the Advanced Search drop down menu.

### Third-Party Resources:
- [Courseography](https://courseography.cdf.toronto.edu/graph): Courseography is a really nice way to visually see all the options available within the CS Department. It provides a friendly way to see the prerequisites for each course as well as way you to navigate them and explore the required prequisites for any course.
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/): Reddit is a surprisingly useful to get the opinion of people that already took a certain course and know what it was like. For that reason, I would take everything with a grain of salt as and you have to see whose opinions you really trust as their mileages may vary. I often find it useful to search for `<course code> uoft reddit` on Google as that usually returns the top posts where people discuss the course.

### Hidden Gems ðŸ’Ž
Some of these may be useful and interesting:

- **Minors**: A lot of students like to explore their interests with a Minor in a different area. CS overlaps quite a bit with some Math and Stats requirements. Therefore, it is no surprise that most students end up doing a Minor in Stats or Math. Other commonly paired Minors include Cognitive Science, Economics, and Biology.
- **Focuses**: Within the Computer Science Major/Specialist, you can choose to pursue a spwcific field of interest. Focuses are tracks that outline recommended courses to take for fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision, Game Design, and System Design. You can find more information about focuses on [UofT's Official Computer Science page](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/Computer-Science).
- **CS Courses**:
  - [CSC458: Computer Networking Systems](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc458h1): The general consensus of the people who took this course is that it is a must for any CS student and they wish they took it earlier.
  - [CSC301: Introduction to Software Engineering](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/csc301h1): You get to experience what it's like to build an end-to-end product for a real client, on top of learning how to manage a team, manage the scope of the project, communicate with a possibly non-technical client, and manage expecations and deadlines. A must-take for anyone going into software development.
- **Engineering Courses**: As a CS/FAS student, you may also take some Engineering courses (check with your registrar for any restrictions). You may also have engineering courses count towards your CS degree, just make sure you notify/ask [Computer Science Undergrad](mailto:cs.undergrad@utoronto.ca). Refer to the [Engineering Calendar](https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/academics-registration/academic-calendar/) for a list of all possible courses. Here are a few notable courses for CS (check the engineering calendar for an accurate description):
  - ECE568: Cyber Security
  - ECE419: Distributed Systems
  - ECE344: Operating Systems

## Extra-curricular Clubs

Extra-curriculars can go a long way towards giving you something similar to work experience, leadership skills and abilities to work with people in a group. It is seen very highly by most companies since it shows that the student is engaged and proactive in their field or community.

There is a huge variety of clubs at UofT realted to computer science, and a lot of people find deciding which ones to join difficult. Here, you will find a list of all the major clubs offered at UofT, separated by field of interest, with each club linking a repository with detailed information such as their website, what they do, how to join, current projects, resources, and why you should join!

Note that the great majority of these clubs are fully student-run and there are many ways of getting involved, so don't hesitate to reach out and get in touch with them.

## Hackathons

Hackathons are a great opportunity to 1) Netowork with companies and peers, 2) build a project for your resume and sharpen your technical skills, and 3) have some fun (hopefully). If you do well, there are often prizes that can include from cash winnings to company interviews.

### Where to Find
- [MLH (Major League Hacking)](https://mlh.io/). MLH runs hackathons throughout the year, many of which require no prior experience. A notable MLH event is *Hack the North*, which is both run at UofT and is also the largest hackathon in Canada.
- [Devpost](https://devpost.com/hackathons). Devpost is a platform solely for finding hackathons, both virtual and in person. 
- Company-Specific. Numerous companies host hackathons to attract talent. If you are interested in working somewhere, be to sure to check if they either host or sponser a hackathon, as performing well in said event can help land interviews.

### Tips
1) Network: while building a project is great, connecting with the companies, mentors, and other students is just as important. Be sure to allocate time for talking with representatives, and be prepared to show off yourself and your skill set. Attend as many networking events, hackathons and workshops to meet a wide variety of people from a wide variety of commpanies, tech and non-tech alike.
2) Don't be scared: no one else knows what they are doing either. Be confident, willing to learn, and always ask and listen to feedback.
3) Try to go with friends: the hackathon experience can be much more fun if you go with a group of people you are comfortable with. That being said, it's perfectly fine to go by yourself and meet new people there.
